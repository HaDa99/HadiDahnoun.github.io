I am Hadi Dahnoun, a driven Development Engineer currently enhancing automated driving systems at Evomotiv GmbH in Stuttgart.
I am parallely pursuing my Master’s degree in Business Informatics at Hochschule Ostfalia and have a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Vehicle Technology from TU Dresden

I am interested in diving deeper into virtual testing to enhance predictive capabilities in automotive development.  I am also exploring opportunities in areas such as data analytics, cloud computing and IT governance in general to apply my skills from the Master's program and align my career path accordingly.
