I am Hadi Dahnoun, a driven Development Engineer currently enhancing automated driving systems at Evomotiv GmbH in Stuttgart.
I am parallely pursuing my Master’s degree in Business Informatics at Hochschule Ostfalia and have a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering with a specialization in Vehicle Technology from TU Dresden

My ambition is to develop an AI-driven automation tool that revolutionizes the validation process in software development, beginning from requirements engineering. 
This tool aims to introduce extensive shortcuts, significantly streamlining the verification and validation phases"
